#exit strategy

##prompt

A widget or plugin that pops up a modal on exit intent. (You've probably seen these before. You're about to close a page when a modal pops up giving you a "final offer" of sorts to keep you from leaving.) The twist is that the content of the modal is customizable based on how long the user was on the page.

# exit strategy

## dependencies
1. NPM
2. Bootstrap (this version uses Bootstrap CDN 5.0.2, but an earlier version would be fine too)
3. jQuery (this version uses jquery-3.6.0.slim.min)
4. [TimeMe.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timeme.js)

## prompt

A widget or plugin that pops up a modal on exit intent. (You've probably seen these before. You're about to close a page when a modal pops up giving you a "final offer" of sorts to keep you from leaving.) The twist is that the content of the modal is customizable based on how long the user was on the page.
